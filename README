Known caveats:
- Server must start before client because server is not able to report its contents
- Empty directories may be left out on server due to this
- Always hashes are used to compute file diffs, timestamps could suffice in most cases. Also this could be better abstracted
- Empty folders are not synced
- Updates are just new file transfers instead of an rsync like algorithm
- Persistent ClientSession could be used in client but I don't know how to do it
- Asyncio could be used on server side when handling multiple requests
- Only tested on local machine
